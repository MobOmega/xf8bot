# xf8bot Privacy Policy
## Collected Data
Collected data by xf8bot includes:
- Guild IDs (e.g. 25211346164)
- User IDs (see above for example)
- Role IDs (see above for example)

No other personally identifiable information is stored.
## Sharing Data
This depends on the hoster, but usually they will use a cloud MongoDB server, hosted by AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.  
See the privacy policies of those hosters.  
In a future update, xf8bot will use encryption for databases. This may render privacy concerns about these hosters invalid.  
## Time Stored
All of the collected data, as in [the collected data section](#collected-data) will be stored indefinitely unless the hoster decides to delete data from the database.  
In a future update, xf8bot will automatically delete data from:
- guilds which have removed xf8bot
- users which have left the guild
- roles which have been deleted
## Logging
Only the following is logged:
- Bot information, including bot administrators
- Errors
- Amount of guilds that the bot is in

**No logs will be stored about who is running what commands.**
## Complaints
If you have a complaint with this privacy policy, please add an issue to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/xf8b/xf8bot/issues/).

This privacy policy was last modified **October 11th, 2020**.
